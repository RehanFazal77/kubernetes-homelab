Virtual Machine(VM) Specification for Kubernetes Homelab

The Kubernetes homelab environment is provisioned using Multipass(you are free to use any other vm). Each virtual machine is configured with the following baseline specifications:

Control Plane Node

multipass launch \
  --name rehan-control-plane \
  --cpus 2 \
  --memory 2G \
  --disk 20G

Worker Node(s)
The same specifications are applied to each worker node for consistency and balanced resource allocation.

Storage Considerations:

Default: 20 GB disk space.

Recommended: 50 GB (if adequate storage capacity is available).

Specifications (CPU, memory, and storage) can be adjusted based on system resources and workload requirements.



This setup provides a lightweight yet flexible environment suitable for experimenting with Kubernetes components, cluster operations and workload scheduling within a local homelab.


old version
multipass launch \
  --name rehan-control-plane \
  --cpus 2 \
  --memory 2G \
  --disk 20G

IF you have enough storage then you can set storage to 50G
you can also modify these spec according to your need   
follow the same specs for workernode
